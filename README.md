# My GNU/Linux Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles (i.e. configuration files).
I use these dotfiles on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).
My goal is to get things done: no fancy stuff here, just a lightweight yet functional setup.

## Programs whose config can be found here

* i3 (i3-gaps) - a tiling window manager
* i3blocks - a status bar for i3
* vim - a text editor
* bash
* [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd) - simple X hotkey daemon, a program for keybindings
* dunst - a lightweight notification daemon
* [i3lock-color](https://github.com/PandorasFox/i3lock-color) - improved i3 lockscreen
* xcompmgr - a compositor (allows windows to be transparent)
* a few scripts, which can be found in `~/.scripts/`
